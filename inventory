# The 'main' file for configuring the hosts is located in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
# But it is better to create a separate inverntory file, which f.e. can be uploaded to git
#
# To avoid specifying the inventory every time you run an ansible command,
# we can create a local ansible.cfg file with defaults pointing to our inventory

# We can split the hosts by groups like this:
[loadbalancer]
server01 ansible_user=server01 ansible_host=192.168.122.212

[webserver]
server02 ansible_user=server02 ansible_host=192.168.122.107
# app02

[database]
server03 ansible_user=server03 ansible_host=192.168.122.191

# Do not forget about the control host as well!
# By default, ansible will attempt to ssh into all the hosts you specify,
# but in this case we are already on control host, so we should specify
# `ansible_connection=local`
[control]
control01 ansible_connection=local
